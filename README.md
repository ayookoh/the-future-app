This simple web application displays driving practice questions in French and English.

### Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. Use the **FR / EN** button to toggle languages.
Click **Show Answer** to reveal the answer and **Next** to move to the next question.

Questions are loaded from `questions.json`, which now also includes an `image`
field for each entry. Images are stored in the `images` folder. A placeholder is
provided for all questions by default. The repository contains a small sample of
questions; you can expand the list by editing the JSON file and adding your own
images.
